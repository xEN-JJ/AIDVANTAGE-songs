Hung Up Lyrics

Team AIDVANTAGE
Tell me, it's a lie
Tell me that you're lying with another man
Look me in the eye
Tell me, was I never what you had in plan?
Detaching over petty fights
You were trying to make me feel that I was wrong
You never tried to apologize

Baby, I was sick of holding on
'Cause every time I do, I do it all alone
Baby, don't hang up the phone again
Just wanna hear your voice when I can't hold your hand
You've been traveling to different places just for taste tests
Then come back to me, my love, it doesn't make sense
Don't hang up the phone again
Baby, don't hang up the phone

Have I sunk so low as to beg you come and comfort me?
When honestly, you're the reason why I always bleed
But, babe, my heart will always beat for you
I've been drifting in and out of sleep
Uncertain if it's day or night, I feel a little lost
Would you save me?
Skinny love
Come and take me, please
No, no
See upcoming R&B shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists

Baby, I was sick of holding on
'Cause every time I do, I do it all alone
Baby, don't hang up the phone again
Just wanna hear your voice when I can't hold your hand
You've been traveling to different places just for taste tests
Then come back to me, my love, it doesn't make sense
Don't hang up the phone again (Don't hang up the phone, babe)
Baby, don't hang up the phone

I'm hung up on you
I'm hung up on you
I'm hung up on you
I'm hung up on you, you
Hmmmm
You
