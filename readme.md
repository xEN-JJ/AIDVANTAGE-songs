      **I was a ghost, I was alone (hah)
        어두워진 앞길 속에 (hah)
        Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
        I was the queen that I'm meant to be
        I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
        But I couldn't find my own place
        Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
        But now that's how I'm getting paid 끝없이 on stage**
      ```

        Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
        I was the queen that I'm meant to be
        I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
        But I couldn't find my own place
        Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
        But now that's how I'm getting paid 끝없이 on stage
    ... 
        You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
        We're gonna be, gonna be
        Born to be, born to be glowin'
        밝게 빛나는 우린

        That's who we're born to be

    I was the queen that I'm meant to be
    I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
    But I couldn't find my own place
    Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
    But now that's how I'm getting paid 끝없이 on stage.
    [Chorus]
    I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
    We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I'll believe
